# About

I made this to practice my react skills, for this project I used `styled-components` instead of `scss` or plane old `css`.

## Optimization
Data is loaded at once not in chunks so page rendering is a little bit slow, it could be optimized with only showing `x` amounts of countries at any given time. Also rendering graphs is really slow since a lot of data is shown at once, that could also be optimized by averaging data, for example instead of showing 400+ of cases we can only show 100 of them by averaging two 4 values into a single one.
